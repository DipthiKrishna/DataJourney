                As the state’s largest and fiercest predator, the grizzly had California to itself for hundreds of
                thousands
                of
                years. They could run 35 miles per hour for short distances, had a humped shoulder, and were
                brown-golden in
                color.
                The loss of habitat and over-hunting by a rapidly growing human population led to their complete
                extinction
                by
                the 1920s. In 1953, the California grizzly became the official State Animal and remains one of the
                state’s
                most
                enduring and visible symbols. Notably, California is the only state in the union that carries the image
                of
                an
                extinct animal on its state flag and seal.
